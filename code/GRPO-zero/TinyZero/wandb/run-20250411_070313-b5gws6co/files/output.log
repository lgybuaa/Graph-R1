Alright, let's tackle this problem using the numbers 46, 9, 6, and 8. The goal is to create an equation using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) such that the result equals 58. Each number can only be used once, and I need to use basic arithmetic operations.

First, I'll list out the numbers and operations available to me:

Numbers: 46, 9, 6, 8
Operations: +, -, *, /

I'll need to combine these numbers and operations to form an expression that equals 58. Since each number can only be used once, I must decide on an order of operations that makes sense.

**Step 1: Choosing an Operation**
I want to start by choosing an operation that gives me an intermediate result close to 58. Let's consider each possible operation and see what happens.

1. **Addition (+):**
If I add two numbers, let's see what happens:
- 46 + 9 = 55
- 46 + 6 = 52
- 46 + 8 = 54
- 9 + 6 = 15
- 9 + 8 = 17
- 6 + 8 = 14

None of these results (55, 52, 54, 15, 17, 14) equal 58.

2. **Subtraction (-):**
Subtracting two numbers might give me a positive result closer to 58:
- 46 - 9 = 37
- 46 - 6 = 40
- 46 - 8 = 38
- 9 - 6 = 3
- 9 - 8 = 1
- 6 - 8 = -2

Again, none of these (37, 40, 38, 3, 1, -2) equal 58.

3. **Multiplication (×):**
Multiplying two numbers will give me a larger intermediate result:
- 46 × 9 = 414
- 46 × 6 = 276
- 46 × 8 = 368
- 9 × 6 = 54
- 9 × 8 = 72
- 6 × 8 = 48

Still, none of these (414, 276, 368, 54, 72, 48) equal 58.

**Step 2: Combining Operations**
Next, I'll consider combining operations to reach 58. Let's try different combinations.

1. **Addition followed by Multiplication:**
- 46 + 9 × 6
- 46 + 54 = 100
- 46 + 9 × 8
- 46 + 72 = 118
- 46 + 6 × 8
- 46 + 48 = 94

None of these (100, 118, 94) equal 58.

2. **Multiplication followed by Addition:**
- (46 + 9) × 6 = 55 × 6 = 330
- (46 + 9) × 8 = 55 × 8 = 440
- (46 + 6) × 9 = 52 × 9 = 468
- (46 + 6) × 8 = 52 × 8 = 416
- (46 + 8) × 9 = 54 × 9 = 486
- (46 + 8) × 6 = 54 × 6 = 324

Still no matches for 58.

3. **Subtraction followed by Multiplication:**
- (46 × 9) - 6 = 414 - 6 = 408
- (46 × 9) - 8 = 414 - 8 = 406
- (46 × 6) - 9 = 276 - 9 = 267
- (46 × 6) - 8 = 276 - 8 = 268
- (46 × 8) - 9 = 368 - 9 = 359
- (46 × 8) - 6 = 368 - 6 = 362

No 58 in these results.
