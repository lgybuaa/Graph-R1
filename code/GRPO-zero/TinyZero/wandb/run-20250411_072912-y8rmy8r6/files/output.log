Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use the numbers 9, 25, 19, and 78 to create an equation that equals 75. Each number can only be used once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Cool, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I think I should list out all the numbers to make sure I don't skip any or use them incorrectly. The numbers are 9, 25, 19, and 78. I need to combine them with the operations and parentheses to make an equation that results in 75.

I know that 75 is somewhere in the middle of these numbers, but I'm not sure where to start. Maybe I can try combining the smaller numbers first and see if that gets me closer to 75. Let's see, combining 9 and 25. If I add them together, I get 34. That's not bad, but it's still much lower than 75.

What if I combine 9 and 25 in a different way? Maybe using subtraction. 25 minus 9 is 16. That's also a start, but 16 is still too low. Maybe multiplication: 9 times 25 is 225. Oh, that's way too high. Division? 25 divided by 9 is about 2.77, which is not helpful either.

Hmm, maybe I should try combining 25 and 19 together. Let's see, adding them gives me 44, subtracting gives 6, multiplying gives 475, and dividing gives around 2.176. 44 is still not enough to get to 75, except if I add more numbers.

Wait, I only have four numbers. Maybe I need to use all of them. Let me try adding all four together: 9 + 25 + 19 + 78. That gives me 131, which is way over 75. Not helpful.

What if I subtract 25 from 78? That gives me 53. Then, if I add the remaining numbers: 9 + 19 + 53, that adds up to 81, which is still more than 75. Close, but not quite.

Maybe combining subtraction and addition correctly. Let's think about it differently. If I have 78, which is relatively large, maybe I can subtract a small number from it. 78 minus 25 is 53, and then add the remaining numbers: 9 + 19 + 53. Again, 81. That gives me a hint but not the exact number I need.

I wonder if I can use division in some clever way. For example, if I take 78 and divide by a small number, say 2, that would be 39. Then, add 9: 39 + 9 = 48. Still too low. If I divide 25 by 5, that's 5, but I don't have a 5 to divide with. Hmm.

Or perhaps dividing a larger number by something. If I take 78 and divide by 3, that's 26. Then, adding 25 and 19: 26 + 25 + 19 = 70, which is close to 75. If only the numbers I've used are in the correct places, I can reach 75. But wait, I used 25, 26, and 19; I haven't used 9 yet. Maybe if I subtract 9 from that 26, I get 17. But then, 17 plus the total in another way?

Not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think step by step:

1. I have to use each number once, so I can't skip any or repeat them.
2. The arithmetic operations can be combined with parentheses to change the order.
3. The goal is to reach 75.

Let me try adding the largest numbers together: 78 + 25 = 103. That's over 75, but if I can subtract other numbers from it...

So, 103 minus something equals 75. 103 - 28 = 75. Can I get 28 from the remaining numbers: 9 and 19? Yes, because 19 + 9 = 28. Therefore, 78 + 25 - (19 + 9) = 75.

Wait, let's check the math:

78 + 25 = 103

103 - (19 + 9) = 103 - 28 = 75

Yes, that works! So, using all four numbers in this equation gives me 75.

Alternatively, there might be other combinations, but let's stick with the one we found first since it involves all the numbers and the operations we used.

To solve the problem of creating an equation using the numbers 9, 25, 19, and 78 to equal 75, follow these steps:

1. **Combine the larger numbers**: Add 78 and 25 together because these give a larger number that can be adjusted with the remaining numbers to reach 75.
   \[
   78 + 25 = 103
   \]

2. **Adjust with smaller numbers**: Subtract the sum of 19 and 9 from 103. This subtraction will decrease the total by 28 because 19 + 9 = 28.
   \[
   103 - (19 + 9) = 103 - 28 = 75
   \]

3. **Final equation**: Combine all the numbers and the subtraction operations to form the equation.
   \[
   78 + 25 - (19 + 9) = 75
   \]

**Answer**: The equation is 75 = 78 + 25 − (19 + 9).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Okay, so I have these numbers: 22, 35, and 82, and I need to use them to make an equation that equals 25. I can only use each number once, and I can use the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Alright, where do I start?

Maybe I should think about how to combine these numbers to get close to 25. Let's see. If I take 22, can I do something with that? Let's try subtraction. 22 minus what number would give me something closer to 25. Hmm, 22 minus (something) would be 25, but I'm not actually trying to get something. Maybe I should look at division first.

Wait, division might be tricky because if I do something like 35 divided by 82, that's a fraction, but how does that help me? Let me write it down: 35 / 82. That's approximately 0.4268, but I'm not sure how that helps me reach 25.

What if I try adding or subtracting the numbers? Let's try something simple. If I take 35 and subtract 22, that gives me 13. How can I use 82 with that? 82 minus 13 is 69, which is way too big. What if I subtract both 22 and 35 from 82? 82 - 22 is 60, and 60 - 35 is 25. Oh, that actually works!

Wait, let me check that again. Start with 82, subtract the first number, 22: 82 - 22 = 60. Then subtract the second number, 35: 60 - 35 = 25. Yep, that makes sense.

So the equation would be 82 - 22 - 35 = 25. Let me make sure each number is used only once. 82 is used once, 22 is used once, 35 is used once, and there's no number left behind. Cool, that works!

To solve the problem using the numbers 22, 35, and 82 to make an equation equal to 25, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Operations**: Use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).

2. **Create an Equation**: Start with the largest number and apply operations to get 25. One approach is to subtract smaller numbers from the largest.

3. **Apply Subtraction**: Subtract 22 from 82 first, then subtract the remaining 35.

Equation:
$$
82 - 22 - 35 = 25
$$
