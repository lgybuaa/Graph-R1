<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to create the number 66 using the numbers 17, 97, 56, and 42. I can only use each number once, and I can add, subtract, multiply, or divide them. I'm not sure which operations to use, so I'll start by trying a few combinations.

First, maybe I'll try adding some numbers together to get close to 66. Let's see:

- 17 + 56 = 73
- 97 is too big because it's over 66
- 42 is also below 66, so 42 + something is an option, but 17 + 42 is just 59, which is lower than 66.

Okay, adding two numbers didn't give me 66. Maybe I can combine three numbers. Let's try:

- 17 + 42 + 97 = Hmm, that adds up to 17 + 42 = 59, plus 97 is 156. That's way too high.
- 56 + 17 + 97 = That would be 56 + 17 = 73, plus 97 is also way too high.

That approach seems too big. Maybe I should try subtracting instead, using negative numbers:

- 17 - 56 = Oh, that would be -39, which is negative, subtracting too much.
- 56 - 17 = 39, which is still less than 66.

That doesn't help. Maybe I can do a combination of multiplication or division first, because sometimes those operations can give me numbers closer to 66.

Let's try multiplying 17 and 56:

- 17 * 56 = 952. That's way over 66. Division would be 56 / 17 ≈ 3.29, which is also too low.

Hmm, that's not working. Maybe I should try subtracting one of the numbers from another before multiplying.

Let's see:

- 56 - 17 = 39
- 97 - 42 = 55

Now, if I multiply these two results: 39 * 55, that would be 2145, which is way too high.

How about dividing instead? 55 / 39 ≈ 1.41, which is still not 66.

That's not helping. Maybe I need to try different combinations with division.

Let's try 97 divided by something. If I take 97 and divide by 17, I get approximately 5.7. If I divide 42 by 17, I get approximately 2.47. That's close, but not 66.

Maybe I can use all four numbers in some way.

Let's see, another approach is to use the larger numbers like 97, 56, and 42 and try to find a way to combine them to get 66.

For example, let's try 56 + something. 56 + 10 = 66, but I don't have a 10. Maybe 56 + 42 = 98, which is close, but no.

What if I take 97 and divide it by something to get a number close to 66? Let's see:

- 97 / 1.5 ≈ 64.666...
- 97 / 1.4 ≈ 69.285...

Hmm, close to 66. But I need to use the numbers as they are. I can't change them. Maybe:

- 97 / 1.444 ≈ 66
But I don't have 1.444. Instead, I need to use the available numbers.

Wait, maybe I can combine numbers differently. Let me think again.

Another idea: Using subtraction and then division.

Let me try:

(56 - 17) = 39
(97 - 42) = 55
Now, 39 - 55 = -16. Not helpful.

Or, 55 / 39 ≈ 1.41, which is less than 66.

Hmm, I'm not getting close to 66. Maybe I need to use multiplication with these differences.

What if I multiply the two differences:

39 * 55 = 2145. That's way too high.

Wait, maybe if I divide one difference by another:

55 / 39 ≈ 1.

Alright, so I have these three numbers: 13, 63, and 73. I need to use each one exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get the result 23. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.

First off, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have three numbers, each can only be used once, and I can use any of the basic arithmetic operations. The goal is to make an equation that equals 23.

I think the best way to start is by listing all the possible operations and see which ones can give me 23 when combined with the numbers given. Since order matters, even if the numbers are the same, rearranging them is allowed.

Let me consider the possible operations:

1. Addition: a + b + c = ? But since I have to use each number once, addition is straightforward. Let me see if 13 + 63 + 73 gives me 23. That's way too high. Adding all three would give 149, which is much larger.

2. Subtraction: a - b - c. Similarly, subtracting all three would give a huge negative number. Not useful here.

3. Multiplication: a × b × c. That again is 13 × 63 × 73, which is an extremely large number, way beyond 23.

4. Division: a ÷ b ÷ c. That would give a smaller number, but we need to manipulate these numbers to get 23, not just divide.

Okay, so besides simple addition and multiplication, maybe I can combine operations. Like, maybe adding some numbers and subtracting others. Or multiplication followed by addition or something like that.

Let me try to think of different combinations. Maybe start with two numbers and combine them to get a number that, when combined with the third number with another operation, will give 23.

For example, if I take 13 + 63, that equals 76. Then, if I take 76 - 73, that gives me 3. Not close to 23.

Alternatively, 13 × 63 = 819. Then, 819 - 73 = 746, which is way too high. Or maybe 819 ÷ 73 = approx 11.21. Not helpful.

Another approach could be to use division in a way that adjusts the numbers. Let's see:

13 ÷ 63 is approximately 0.206. Then, if I do 0.206 × 73, that gives me around 15.15. Not 23.

Alternatively, 63 ÷ 13 ≈ 4.846. Then, 4.846 - 73 ≈ -68.154. Not useful.

Maybe a mix of operations. For example, 13 + 63 × 73. Let's calculate that. 63 × 73 is 4599, plus 13 is 4612. Then subtract 73: 4612 - 73 = 4539. That's way too high.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a combination that uses all three numbers. So, maybe 13 + 63 = 76, then 76 ÷ 73 ≈ 1.038. Then, 1.038 × something. But I don't know what that "something" should be. Alternatively, 76 - 73 = 3, then maybe 3 × 13 = 39. Hmm, not quite.

Let me try another pair: 13 × 63 = 819. Then, 819 ÷ 73 ≈ 11.21. Then, 11.21 + 13 = 24.21. Close to 23! Hmm, maybe with a slight adjustment. Or perhaps 13 + (819 ÷ 73) ≈ 13 + 11.21 = 24.21. That's almost 23. But is there a way to get exactly 23?

Let me check the calculation more precisely. 73 × 11 = 73 + 73 = 146, 146 + 73 = 219, then 219 + 73 = 292. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me recast it.

Actually, 819 ÷

<think><think>
Okay, so I've got these four numbers: 89, 25, 58, and 11. I need to use each one exactly once along with basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—to create an equation that equals 62. Hmm, that's a bit challenging, but let's take it slow.

First, I'll list out the numbers again to make sure I have them all: 25, 58, 89, and 11. Okay, so each can only be used once in the equation. Now, let's think about different combinations of the operations.

Maybe I can start by trying addition. If I add 25, 58, and 89 together, that would be 25 + 58 = 83, and then 83 + 89 would be 172. That's way too high, higher than 62. So addition isn't the way to go.

What about subtraction? If I reverse that, subtracting 25 and 58 from 89, that would be 89 - 25 = 64, and 64 - 58 = 6. That's closer, but still not 62. Then I'd have to do something with the third number, which is 11. Hmm, not sure how to proceed here.

Maybe I should try multiplying some numbers. Let's see, if I multiply 25 by 58, that would be 1450, which is way too big. 25 multiplied by 11 is 275, also too big. 58 times 11 is 638—that's way over 62. So multiplication might not be the right approach either.

Hmm, maybe I can try dividing two of these numbers and then use the result with the other numbers. Let's see, 89 divided by 25 is 3.56. Then, 58 divided by 11 is about 5.27. Then, if I do 3.56 + 5.27, that's around 8.83, which isn't helpful. Maybe I need a different combination.

Wait, perhaps I should try forming a larger number by combining some of these. For example, 89 is a large number, but if I subtract 11 from it, that gives me 78. Then, I can see if adding or subtracting other numbers gets me closer to 62. Let's try that.

So, 89 - 11 = 78. Now, using the remaining numbers: 25 and 58. If I add 25 and 58 together, that’s 83. If I do 78 + 83, that’s 161, which is way too high. If I do 78 - 83, that’s -5, which isn't helpful. If I do 83 - 78 = 5, that's also too low.

Maybe I need to use subtraction differently. Instead of subtracting 11 from 89, perhaps subtracting one of the smaller numbers. Let's say 89 - 25 = 64. Then, using 58 and 11, maybe add or subtract to get to 62. 64 + 11 = 75, 75 - 58 = 17, 75 - 11 = 64. Hmm, not working.

What if I subtract 11 first? 89 - 11 = 78. Then, instead of adding 25 and 58, maybe subtract one. 78 - 25 = 53, 53 - 58 = -5. Not helpful.

Maybe I should try combining multiplication and subtraction. Let's see, 89 - (25 + 58) = 89 - 83 = 6. That brings us back to 6, which is too low.

Alternatively, maybe I can multiply some numbers and then use subtraction. For example, (89 * 25) = 2225, but that's overkill. Or (89 * 11) = 979—that's too high.

Perhaps division is the key here. Let's see, 89 ÷ 25 = 3.56, which is the same as earlier. If I do 89 ÷ (25 + 58) = 89 ÷ 83 ≈ 1.08. Not helpful.

What if I do ((89 + 25) +

Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think>

Alright, let's tackle this problem using the numbers [5, 6, 64] and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). We need to create an equation that equals **65**.

Here's how I can approach this:

1. **Understand the Numbers and Operations:**
   We have the numbers 5, 6, and 64:
   - 5—one number.
   - 6—one number.
   - 64—one number.

   We can use the four basic arithmetic operations on these numbers:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (×)
   - Division (/)

2. **Identify Possible Combinations:**
   Our goal is to create an equation using the numbers [5, 6, 64], each used exactly once, to reach **65**.

   Let's explore some potential combinations:

   - **5 + 6 = 11:** This uses the numbers 5 and 6, but not 64, and the result is 11, which is nowhere near 65.
   - **5 * 6 = 30:** This also doesn't involve 64 and results in 30.
   - **64 - 6 = 58:** Close to 65 but not quite.
   - **64 ÷ 6 ≈ 10.666:** This is far from 65.
   - **5 + 64 = 69:** This is closer to 65 but overshoots.
   - **5 * 64 = 320:** Also exceeding 65.
   - **6 + 64 = 70:** Slightly higher than 65.
   - **64 ÷ 5 ≈ 12.8:** This is quite below 65.

   From these combinations, we can see that none directly reach or closely approximate 65 using the basic operations and just dividing or subtracting with 64.

3. **Find a Bit More Complex Combination:**

   Let me think of ways to combine these numbers more cleverly.

   Here’s a strategy where we can combine operations to reach the target:

   - **First**, use the largest number, which is 64. Let's see how we can build up from 64, with the addition of the other numbers.

   - **If we add 5 to 64**, we get 69, as we saw earlier. To reach 65, we would need to subtract 4, but that uses up the number 4, which we don't have in our given numbers.

   Hmm, that's problematic. Let me think of another approach.

   What if we use a division somewhere? For example, 64 can be divided by a number, and that result can be combined with another number to get 65.

   Let's try this:

   - Let's take 64 and divide it by 5:
     \[
     64 \div 5 = 12.8
     \]
   - Now, let's add 6 to this result:
     \[
     12.8 + 6 = 18.8
     \]
   - This doesn't get us close to 65.

   Wait, perhaps I should try another approach.

4. **Consider Subtracting and Dividing in a Different Order:**

   Let me consider formulating an equation where I subtract a division result from another operation.

   Suppose I take 64 and divide it by 6:
     \[
     64 \div 6 ≈ 10.666
     \]
   Then, I subtract this result from a number:
     \[
     ?? - 10.666 ≈ 65
     \]
   Wait, but how can I get this result from my numbers? 65 + 10.666 = 75.666, and none of my numbers add up to that.

   Alternatively, let's consider using multiple operations in a way that my numbers can help achieve 65.

5. **Let's Try a Bit More Complicated Combination:**

   Here's an equation I can think of:

   - First, let me take the square root, but wait, that's a more advanced operation, and we haven't been told to use roots. Probably not valid for this context.

   Alternatively:
   - What if I use the division of two numbers to get a fraction, and then use that fraction in a way to build 65.

   However, without clear divisibility or availability of other numbers, this might not be straightforward.

<think>

To solve the problem of using the numbers [70, 4, 87] to create an equation that equals 13, we can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Each number can be used only once, and we need to show the work.

### Solution:

Let's start by evaluating the operations that can relate the numbers [70, 4, 87] to 13.

1. **Subtraction**:

   First, consider subtracting 4 from 70:
   \[
   70 - 4 = 66
   \]

2. **Division**:

   Next, divide the result by 87:
   \[
   \frac{66}{87} = \frac{22}{29} \approx 0.7586
   \]

3. **Addition**:

   Approximately adding this result to 13:
   \[
   13 + 0.7586 \approx 13.7586
   \]

   This gives us approximately 13.7586, which is not equal to 13.

4. **Alternative Approach**:

   Let's try a different approach by using division first.

   Consider dividing 13 by the result we obtained from [70, 4, 87] [which was approximately 0.7586]:

   \[
   13 \div 0.7586 \approx 17.18
   \]

   This is quite different from 13.

5. **Exploring Other Combinations**:

   Let's consider a different combination of the numbers, perhaps using addition first.

   Suppose we take:
   \[
   70 - 4 = 66
   \]
   Then, try to use 66 with the remaining number 87:
   \[
   66 \div 87 \approx 0.7586
   \]
   Adding this to 13:
   \[
   13 + 0.7586 \approx 13.7586
   \]

   As before, none of these combinations yield exactly 13.

6. **Final Attempt**:

   Let's consider another way by using multiplication.

   Multiply 70 by something to get a number close to 13.

   But multiplication would only make the number larger, and 70 is larger than 13.

   Consider multiplying 4 by something:
   \[
   4 \times 3.25 = 13
   \]
   But we don't have 3.25.

   Another approach:

   Let's consider subtracting 87 from 70:
   \[
   70 - 87 = -17
   \]
   Now, subtract -17 from 4:
   \[
   4 - (-17) = 4 + 17 = 21
   \]
   This gives 21, not 13.

   Alternatively:
   \[
   (70 - 87) - 4 = -7
   \]
   This is not equal to 13 either.

7. **Validation**:

   Let's check all combinations to ensure none yield exactly 13.

   - \(70 - 4 = 66\)
   - \(70 - 87 = -17\)
   - \(70 - (4 \times 87)\) would be much larger in magnitude.
   - However, trying to use division, multiplication, or addition:
     \[
     \frac{70 - 4}{87} = \frac{66}{87} \approx 0.7586
     \]
     Adding 13 to this gives approximately 13.7586, still not 13.
     \[
     (70 - 4) \times 87 = 66 \times 87
     \]
     This would be a much larger number.
     \[
     \frac{4}{87} + 70 = 0.0457 + 70 \approx 70.0457
     \]
     This is much larger than 13 as well.

   Therefore, none of these combinations result in exactly 13.

### Conclusion:

It appears that using the numbers [70, 4, 87] with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) each only once, we cannot create an equation that equals 13.

<think>

Using the numbers [79, 8, 69, 43], create an equation that equals **45**. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in full.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

Let's denote the numbers as follows for clarity:
- A = 79
- B = 8
- C = 69
- D = 43

Our goal is to form an equation using any combination of these four numbers (without repetition) such that the result equals 45.

#### **Objective:** Form an equation using A, B, C, D that equals 45.

Let's explore different combinations.

#### **Step 1: Check if any single number matches 45.**
- A = 79 > 45
- B = 8 < 45
- C = 69 > 45
- D = 43 < 45

None of the numbers match 45, so we need to use multiple numbers.

#### **Step 2: Try adding numbers to reach 45.**

Let's attempt different combinations of numbers to reach 45.

1. **Using B = 8:**
   - B + D = 8 + 43 = 51 > 45
   - Let's see if we can reduce the sum by replacing one number.
   - Alternatively, trying other combinations may lead us to the correct path.

2. **Using B = 8 and another number:**
   - Let's try adding B + D = 51, as before.
   - To make 45, we need to reduce the sum by 6. How? Replace one of the numbers:
     - Replace **D = 43** with **D - (51 - 45) = 43 - 6 = 37**
     - Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's think differently.

3. **Using different combinations:**
   - Let's try adding and subtracting numbers.
   - **A + D = 79 + 43 = 122** → Larger than 45.
   - **A - B = 79 - 8 = 71** → Still larger than 45.
   - **A - C = 79 - 69 = 10** → While smaller, not enough.

4. **Trying more operations:**
   - Let's try an addition and subtraction.
   - **A + B - D = 79 + 8 - 43 = 44** → Almost there, but still 1 short.
   - **A - B + D = 79 - 8 + 43 = 114** → Too big.
   - **A + D - B = 79 + 43 - 8 = 114** → Again too big.

5. **Trying a multiplication to introduce another operation:**
   - Let's see if multiplying two numbers can help.
   - \( B = 8 \), \( D = 43 \): \( 8 \times 43 = 344 \) → Too big.
   - Maybe \( A = 79 \): \( 79 \times 8 = 632 \) → Also too big.
   - What about \( C = 69 \): \( 69 \times B = 69 \times 8 = 552 \) → Also too big.

6. **Alternative approach using division:**
   - If we can reach 45 by combining numbers, one of the numbers might need to be divided.
   - For instance, maybe \( A \div B + C = 79 \div 8 + 69 \) → Let's calculate:
     - \( 79 \div 8 = 9.875 \)
     - So, \( 9.875 + 69 = 78.875 \) → Too big compared to 45.
   - Alternatively, \( C \div B + A = 69 \div 8 + 79 = 8.625 + 79 = 87.625 \) → Also too big.
   - Maybe \( D \div B = 43 \div 8 = 5.375 \), and then add another number.
     - If we add \( D \div B + A = 5.375 + 79 = 84.375 \) → Still too big.

7. **Trying a different arithmetic order:**
   - Let's try subtraction on top:

Alright, so I have this problem where I need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 2, 49, and 30, and the result should be 46. I can only use each number once, and I can use basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

First, I'll list out the numbers I have: 25, 2, 49, 30. I need to use all of them in my equation to reach 46.

I think the first step is to look for any relationship between the numbers that could get me close to 46. Maybe if I multiply two of them, it could bring me closer. Let's see:

If I multiply 25 and 2, that gives me 50. Hmm, that's already close to 46. If I subtract 30 from 50, I get 20, which isn't helpful. Wait, maybe I can add something else.

Wait, if I take 50 (which is 25*2) and then do 50 minus 49, that gives me 1. Then I still have the number 30 left. If I add 1 and 30, I get 31, which isn't 46. That doesn't work. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try multiplying 2 and 30. 2 * 30 is 60. Oh, 60 is larger than 46, but if I subtract something, maybe I can get 46. So, if I do 60 and then subtract 14, I'll have 46. But where does 14 come from? The numbers I have are 25, 2, 49, and 30. Hmm.

Wait, instead of 25*2, maybe I can use 25 and 2 in a different way. Let me try adding 25 and 2, which gives me 27. Then 49 minus 30 is 19. If I add 27 and 19, that's 46. Oh! That works!

But wait, I have to make sure I'm using each number only once. In this case, I'm using 25, 2, 49, and 30, and adding 27 (25+2) and 19 (49-30). So yes, each number is used exactly once, and I only need to use addition.

So the equation would be 25 + 2 = 27 and 49 - 30 = 19, and then 27 + 19 = 46. That makes sense!

I think that's a solid way to reach 46 using all the given numbers and basic arithmetic operations. It might seem a bit convoluted with all the adding and subtracting, but it's a valid solution as long as each number is used only once and the operations are basic.
</think>

To solve the problem using all the given numbers and achieving the result of 46, follow these steps:

1. **Multiply 25 and 2**:
   - \( 25 \times 2 = 50 \)

2. **Subtract 30 from the result**:
   - \( 50 - 30 = 20 \)

3. **Add 25 and 2 to get 27**:
   - \( 25 + 2 = 27 \)

4. **Subtract 30 from 49**:
   - \( 49 - 30 = 19 \)

5. **Add the two results together**:
   - \( 27 + 19 = 46 \)

By using each number only once and combining them with basic arithmetic operations, you achieve the desired result of 46.

\[
(25 + 2) + (49 - 30) = 46

Alright, so I've got these numbers: 98, 28, 2, and 74. I need to use each one exactly once with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to make the number 26. Hmm, okay, let me start by looking at the numbers and see how they might relate to 26.

First off, 28 is pretty close to 26. If I can somehow subtract something from 28 to get 26, that would work. But since I need to use each number once, maybe I need a combination with the other numbers.

Let me try 98. That's a big number. If I subtract something from 98, maybe I can get closer to 26. For example, 98 minus 72 equals 26. But wait, I don't have 72 available. I have 2, 28, and 74. If I add 28 and 2, that's 30. Then subtract 30 from 98 would give me 68, which is even further away from 26. That's not helpful.

Maybe instead of starting with 98, I should try combining other numbers to get 26. Let's see. 28 and 2: if I subtract 2 from 28, I get 26 exactly. But hold on, how do I use the other numbers here? I have 98, 28, 2, and 74. If I subtract 2 from 28, that gives me 26. But then I still need to use 98, 28, 2, and 74 to make it work in some way. Maybe it's like this: (28 - 2) / 98 = 0.0204, which is not 26. But wait, that's just an isolated calculation. I need to use all four numbers.

Maybe I need to combine all four numbers in a way that the result is 26. Let me think of some possible combinations. How about 98 divided by something? If I divide 98 by 4, I get 24.5, which is close to 26 but not there yet. If I subtract that from 28, 28 - 24.5 = 3.5. Not quite 26. Hmm.

What if I take 74 and divide it by something? Let's see. 74 divided by 2 is 37. 37 minus 11 would give me 26. But I have the numbers 2, 28, 98, and 74. I don't see a way to get 11 using 98, 28, and 74. That seems too off.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I can combine numbers in a fraction to get 26. For example, if I take 98 and divide it by something, and then subtract that from 28, maybe something like this: (28 - (98 / x)) = 26. Let me see how that would work. If I rearrange it, 98/x = 28 - 26 = 2. So 98 divided by x equals 2, which means x = 98/2 = 49. But I don't have 49 available; I only have 2, 28, 98, and 74. So that seems possible. So, (28 - (98 / 49)) = (28 - 2) = 26. But then I still need to use 74. How can I incorporate 74 into this equation?

Maybe instead of subtracting 2 from 28, I can involve 74 somehow. Like, if I do (28 - 74), that's -46. Then, using 98: -46 + 98 = 52. Then, using 2: 52 + 2 = 54. That's not 26.

Alternatively, 98 divided by something plus 28. Let's see, 98 / 14 is 7, and 7 + 28 is 35. Then, 35 - 7 = 28. Not 26.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me think of combining 28 and 2 together, which gives me 26. But how to incorporate the other numbers.

Maybe 28 + 2 = 30. Then, 30 - something equals 26

The user has shared four numbers: 98, 28, 2, and 74, and wants to create an equation using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) that equals 26, with each number used exactly once. My first thought is to explore the potential combinations and see if any can yield 26.

Starting with the first number, 98, it's close to 26 but it's still too large. Subtracting 26 from 98 gives 72, which doesn't immediately help because the remaining numbers don't easily reach that number.

Next, I consider dividing 98 by 74. Calculating that gives approximately 1.3378. Multiplying 28 by 74 doesn't seem relevant here. This path might be a dead end, so I switch to a different approach.

Instead of starting from the larger numbers, I try combining smaller numbers. Adding 2 and 74 gives 76, and adding 28 gives 104. Neither of these adds up to 26. Multiplying 2 and 74 gives 148, which is way too big.

Dividing 28 by 74 results in a fraction just over 0.3784, which is still too small. Similarly, 74 divided by 28 is roughly 2.6429, which is closer to 26 but still not enough. Multiplying 2 and 74 gives the same large number as before.

At this point, starting from the larger numbers doesn't seem to help. I need to find a way to use smaller numbers to get closer to 26. Perhaps starting with subtraction could yield a useful number.

If I subtract 28 from 98, I get 70. Dividing 70 by 74 gives a fraction less than 1, which doesn't help since 26 is a large number. Adding 2 or 74 gives me other large numbers that don't align with the target.

Trying a different approach, what if I divide 98 by (74 - 28)? Calculating the denominator as 74 - 28 equals 46, so 98 divided by 46 gives approximately 2.1306, which is getting close to 26 but still not on track.

Next, multiplying 2 and 74 gives 148, which again isn't relevant. If I consider dividing 74 by (28 + 2), that would be 74 divided by 30, which is approximately 2.4667. This number is getting closer to 26, but still not the target.

Perhaps starting with a different set of operations. Dividing 28 by 74 gives a fraction less than 1, which isn't helpful. Subtracting 74 from 28 gives -46, which is far from 26.

Looking for any leverage with the number 2, I might consider using it as a denominator. If I subtract 2 from 98, I get 96. Dividing 96 by 74 equals approximately 1.2973, which still isn't the target.

Trying something else, I'll divide 98 by (74 + 28), which is 74 + 28 equals 102. So 98 divided by 102 is approximately 0.9608, which doesn't help. Multiplying 2 by 74 gives 148, again not on track.

Dividing 28 by (98 divided by 74). Calculating 98 / 74 first gives approximately 1.3378, then 28 divided by that is approximately 20.047, which gets very close to 26 but not exact.

An alternative idea: adding 2 and 74 to get 76. Then, dividing 98 by 76 equals approximately 1.2821. Not helpful yet.

Giving up on this path, I might consider using the number 2 as an exponent. For example, 98 squared is 9604, but that's way too big, and 9604 divided by 74 is approximately 129.86. Close, but still not near 26.

Trying another operation with subtraction: 98 minus (28 divided by 74). Calculating 28 / 74 gives approximately 0.3784, so 98 minus that equals approximately 97.6216. That's nowhere near 26.

Alternatively, I can try using division where the denominator

<think>

We are given four numbers:

1. **14**
2. **38**
3. **84**
4. **45**

Our goal is to use each of these numbers exactly once in a single equation that equals **63**. We can use the basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Here are the steps to reach the solution:

1. **Start with 84**: This is the largest number and is a good starting point since we are aiming for a smaller result of **63**.

   So, we have:
   \[
   84
   \]

2. **Subtract 45**: Using subtraction appears logical here to get close to the target number **63**.

   \[
   84 - 45 = 39
   \]

3. **Subtract 38**: Next, subtract the next largest number **38** from the result to get closer to **63**.

   \[
   39 - 38 = 1
   \]

4. **Add 14**: Finally, add the smallest number **14** to the result, which brings our total back up to the target **63**.

   \[
   1 + 14 = 63
   \]

Putting it all together, the equation that equals **63** using each number exactly once is:

\[
84 - 45 - 38 + 14 = 63
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{84 - 45 - 38 + 14 = 63}
