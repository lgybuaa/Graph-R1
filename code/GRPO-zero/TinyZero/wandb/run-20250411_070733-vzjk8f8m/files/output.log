Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. We have the numbers 52, 20, and 40, and we need to create an equation that equals 50 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number can only be used once.

First, I'll list out the numbers to have them in front of me:
52, 20, 40

Now, I need to see how these numbers can be combined with the operations (+, -, *, /) to get 50. Let's think about possible combinations.

One approach is to combine two numbers and then use the third number with an operation to reach the desired result. For example:
- 52 combined with 20: 52 - 20 = 32
- Then, combining 32 with 40: 32 + 40 = 72, which is too big.

So, that doesn't work.

Another idea: Maybe subtract 20 from 40 first. 40 - 20 = 20
Then, 52 combined with 20: 52 + 20 = 72, again too big.

Hmm, not working.

Let's try multiplying two numbers and then see what can be done with the third. For example:
Multiplying 52 and 20: 52 * 20 = 1040
That's way too big. Let's try a different multiplication.

Maybe 52 * 40 = 2080
Still too big. Let's try a smaller multiplier.

52 * 0.5 = 26
Then combining that with 20 and 40 might help, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 52 divided by 20 is 2.6
Then, combining 2.6 with 40 and 20... How?

Maybe 2.6 + 40 = 42.6
That's not 50.

Or, 2.6 * 20 = 52
But we only have 52 once.

Wait, perhaps we can create a fraction that brings us closer to 50.

Let me think differently. What if I divide 52 by 20? That gives me 2.6
Then, subtracting that from 40: 40 - 2.6 = 37.4
Still not 50.

Alternatively, maybe adding the result of 52 divided by 20 to 40.

52/20 = 2.6
2.6 + 40 = 42.6
Not 50.

Wait, maybe if I subtract 20 from 40. 40 - 20 = 20
Then add this to 52 divided by something.

But 52 divided by something would be tricky to get to 20.

Wait, perhaps I can think of another way.

Another idea: 52 minus 50 is 2. So if I can get 2 using the remaining numbers, that might work. But we only have 20 and 40 left. 20 divided by 40 is 0.5
So 52 - (20 / 40) = 52 - 0.5 = 51.5
That's close to 50, but no good.

Alternatively, 52 - (40 / 20) = 52 - 2 = 50
Wait, is that correct?

40 divided by 20 is indeed 2.
So 52 - 2 is 50.

Yes, that works!

Let me verify:
52 - (40 / 20) = 52 - 2 = 50

Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 52 - (40 / 20) = 50.
</think>

To solve the problem of creating an equation using the numbers 52, 20, and 40 to equal 50, we can proceed as follows:

1. Start with the number 52.
2. Divide 40 by 20, which equals 2.
3. Subtract the result of step 2 from 52.

The equation is:
52 - (40 / 20) = 50

**Answer:**
The equation is completed as follows:
52 − (40 ÷ 20) = 50<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
