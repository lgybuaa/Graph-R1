Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use the numbers 45, 9, 27, and 69 to create an equation that equals 67. I can only use each number once, and I can only use the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to think about the numbers I have: 45, 9, 27, and 69. I notice that 45 and 69 are both odd numbers, while 9 and 27 are multiples of 9, which might be useful. I'm also trying to figure out if combining these numbers through different operations will get me close to 67.

Maybe I can start by seeing if adding or subtracting any two numbers gets me near 67. Let's see:

45 + 9 = 54
45 + 27 = 72
45 + 69 = 114
9 + 27 = 36
9 + 69 = 78
27 + 69 = 96

Hmm, none of these add up neatly to 67. Let me try subtraction instead:

45 - 9 = 36
45 - 27 = 18
45 - 69 = -24
9 - 27 = -18
9 - 69 = -60
27 - 69 = -42

This isn't getting me anywhere close. Maybe I need to try multiplying numbers instead of adding or subtracting. Let's see:

45 * 9 = 405
45 * 27 = 1215
45 * 69 = 3105
9 * 27 = 243
9 * 69 = 621
27 * 69 = 1863

These products are way too big, and none of them seem close to 67. So maybe combining multiplication with addition or subtraction could help, but it's getting complicated. Let me try dividing instead to see if there's a way to get 67.

45 / 9 = 5
45 / 27 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666...
45 / 69 = 5/13 ≈ 0.377...

Hmm, again, these aren't giving me something close to 67. Maybe I can think about fractions differently or look for patterns in the numbers. Let's try a different approach: starting from the numbers and seeing if we can get to 67 by working backwards.

Suppose I take 45 and then see what operations I can perform on it using 9, 27, and 69 to get to 67. Let's consider:

45 + 9 = 54
45 + 27 = 72
45 + 69 = 114
45 - 9 = 36
45 - 27 = 18
45 - 69 = -24

None of these get me to 67. How about dividing:

45 / 9 = 5
45 / 27 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666...
45 / 69 = 5/13 ≈ 0.377...

Still not 67. What if I try combining multiple operations, like multiplication and addition? Let's try:

(45 * 9) + 27 = 405 + 27 = 432
(45 * 27) + 9 = 1215 + 9 = 1224
(45 * 69) + 27 = 3105 + 27 = 3132

These are way too big. Maybe smaller operations are better:

(9 * 27) + 45 = 243 + 45 = 288
(27 * 69) + 9 = 1863 + 9 = 1872

Still not 67. Division seems tricky. Maybe I should consider using subtraction and division in a more intertwined way. Let's think about 45, 9, 27, and 69 in a different way.

Let's look at the numbers to see if any of them can be expressed in terms of others. For example:

9 = 45 / 5, but I don't have a 5.
27 = 9 * 3
