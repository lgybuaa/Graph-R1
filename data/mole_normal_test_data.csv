"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.
