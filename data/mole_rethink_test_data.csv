"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

Your Response Must Include: A sequence of strict ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers for each property in order, separated by spaces (e.g., Yes No Yes No), and a concise explanation for your choices, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

Provide an estimated possibility value of the positive answer ""yes""(ranging from 0 to 1). 
A higher value indicates a stronger likelihood of the positive answer ""yes"".
A lower value indicates a stronger likelihood of the negative answer ""no"".

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide 3 candidate answers with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider each of your candidate answers as if they were the correct answer and evaluate their feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

"Determine whether the chemical compound represented by the following given molecular graph (nodes with atomic features and bond relationships) is predicted to exhibit activity (effectiveness) in each of the provided bioassays.

The provided bioassays:
property0:The molecule is effective to the following assay. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are a type of retrovirus, which induce acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).  Now there are six main classes of antiretroviral drugs to treating AIDs patients approved by FDA, which are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the protease inhibitors, the integrase inhibitor, the fusion inhibitor, and the chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist. Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48.

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:
<think>
<structure>Here show your structure analysis</structure>
<semantic>Here show your semantic analysis</semantic>
<comprehensive>Here show your comprehensive reasoning and list your target range</comprehensive>

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
Your full response must follow this format:

Your Response Must Include: A numerical answer, and the mathematical solution process, referencing important structural features and the biological assay context.

You are a chemistry expert assistant specialized in molecular graph regression tasks.

Given a molecular graph with atomic features and bond relationships, you are asked to approximate the target value using the formula mentioned in calculation requirements.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the molecular structure based on the provided nodes and edges.
- Identify key chemical features that influence the target value (e.g., number and position of Cl atoms, ring systems, stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding capability).
- Estimate the target value based on the formula.
- Provide a final numeric prediction rounded to two decimal places.

You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>.
Inside <think> and </think>, you should include:
- Structure information within <structure> and </structure>.
- Semantic similarities within <semantic> and </semantic>.
After structure and semantic analysis, you must provide the range of target with brief reasoning inside <comprehensive> and </comprehensive>.
Then, you must conduct re-reasoning inside <rethink> and </rethink>. In this section, you should detailed consider your target range as if it were the correct range and evaluate its feasibility.
After re-reasoning, you must conduct your final answer based on your above analysis.
Finally, besides your reasoning, give your final response.

Please adjust the units of your final result so that the numerical value falls within the range of -30 to 30.
Round the result to two decimal places.
